## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
library(Matrix)

# Load the file
# Load the dataset
New.data <- Read10X(data.dir =  "/Volumes/Uchenna_MacDesk/UchennaDesktop/Desktop/BarnesLab/SingleCellRNASeq/YoungCardiacOldCardiacEndothelialCells/Project_CEL171114AB_Data/New/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/mm10")

# Lets save the file as a csv file so we can use other software to
# analyse the single cell data
Young = as.matrix(x=New.data)
# Confirm the number of cells and genes
dim(Young)
# 27998 genes as rows and 3165 cells as columns. The cells were
# annotated with bar codes. But for this file, I want to replace the
# bar codes with numbers.
# First lets transpose the data to have the cells as rows
Young_transposed = t(Young)
# Sanity check
dim(Young_transposed)
Young_transposed[1:3,1:3]
# Now add a new column with Cell numbering from 1 to 3165
Young_transposed = cbind(Young_transposed,'CellNames'=1:nrow(Young_transposed))
# Sanity Check
dim(Young_transposed)
Young_transposed[1:3,27998:27999]
# Convert matrix to dataframe
Young_transposed_df = as.data.frame(Young_transposed)
# Sanity Check
dim(Young_transposed_df)
# Attach the name Cell to all the numbers
Young_transposed_df$CellNames <- paste("Cell",Young_transposed_df$CellNames, sep="_")
# Set the CellName column as the row names
rownames(Young_transposed_df)=Young_transposed_df$CellNames
# Sanity check
Young_transposed_df[1:3,1:3]
# Drop the last column 
Young_transposed_df$CellNames = NULL
# Sanity check
dim(Young_transposed_df)
Young_transposed_df[1:3,1:3]
Young_transposed_df[1:3,27997:27998]
# Now lets retranspose the data so genes are rows and the cells are columns
Young_df = t(Young_transposed_df)
# Sanity Check
dim(Young_df)
Young_df[1:3,1:3]
# Save as a csv file 
write.csv(Young_df,'YoungCardiacEndothelialCells.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
