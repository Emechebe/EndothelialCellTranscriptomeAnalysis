# Identifying gene expression differences between Young cluster 5 and Aged cluster 5 using Seurat FindMarkers function

# R file is called Cluster5FindMarkers.Rmd

# To do that, I added 2 extra columns called Cluster_Age or Age_Cluster. Each column annotates each cell by cluster and age. I also ran a tsne using the Cluster_Age column as annotation.
# It is called tsne_clusters_by_age

So I can set  findmarkers to Young_5 and Old_5 to perform DE and find gene differences between the two.

 # Result saved as Cluster5AgeDifferences.csv
# Result table annotation
# p_val : Unadjusted p_values
# avg_logFC : log fold change. Positive values are genes that are more in the first cluster passed
# pct.1 : The percentage of cells where the gene is detected in the first group
# pct.2 : The percentage of cells where the gene is detected in the first group
# p_val_adj : Bonferroni adjusted p values
