# Read in the data
# I couldnt use the gene names as rows since there were duplicates
GeneExpression = read.csv('Combined_5_clusters.csv',row.names = 1)
# So I didnt use the above code but use the one below with no row names assignment
GeneExpression = read.csv('Combined_5_clusters.csv')
# Confirm that we have duplication in the Genes column
length(unique(GeneExpression$Genes)) == nrow(GeneExpression)
# This says false and confirms the presence of a duplicate gene.
# Find the duplicate by first creating a frequency table of the genes
n_occur <- data.frame(table(GeneExpression$Genes))
# Ask which one has more than 1
n_occur[n_occur$Freq > 1,]
# The culprit is row 759 and 12549 
# So remove one of the row which is row 759
GeneExpression1 <- GeneExpression[-c(759), ]
# Test again to make sure there are no duplicates

# I have the gene matrix of both young and old plvap positive cells in this data. The label of the cells
# are in a file called GroupAnnotation5_clusters. The idea is to split these into young and old files, then
# for each condition split into 5 and calculate a reference bulk and then perform a differential analysis
# I am more comfortable scripting in python , so I decided to save this file and move this analysis into python environment
write.csv(GeneExpression1,'GeneExpressionMatrix.csv')




















# Our initial analysis show an interesting cluster 5 group that also seem to have an age component
# We have speculated that this cluster could be fenestrated endothelial cells as they are enriched
# for Plvap. It is an interesting prospect that this endothelial subtype is more affected by age
# than other clusters
# So the idea here was to subset this cluster (both the young and Old) and rerun the analysis
# The subsetted data for the cluster is called Group5Rawdata.csv (See Combined
# Seurat1 for the subsetting of this)

# First make the expression data as a sparse data frame to speed up computation. 
# Our combined data is not numeric, so convert the data frame to numeric

# Normalizing the data
# After removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result.

# Found 3106 variable genes

# Seurat v2.0 implements this regression as part of the data scaling process. Therefore, the RegressOut function has been deprecated, and replaced with the vars.to.regress argument in ScaleData.
Group5.object6 <- ScaleData(object = Group5.object5, vars.to.regress = c("nUMI", "percent.mito"))
# Perform a linear dimension reduction on the scaled data

# Lets switch the id to CellType so we can cluster by young or old
expressionTsne_2 <- SetAllIdent(object = Group5.object9, id = "CellType")
# Plot
TSNEPlot(object = expressionTsne_2)

# saved both results as Group5_reclustering and Group5_reclustering_Young_Old

# There seem to be no identifiable clustering due to age or any other discernible variable. 
# Maybe next step is to do a differential gene analysis between young group 5 and old group 5
# My plan is to randomly divide the young cells into 5 groups and also old cells into 5 groups
# Then perform differential gene analysis

# After meeting with Andrew, he suggested I should look at Seurat to 
# see if I can get gene differences within cluster 5.
