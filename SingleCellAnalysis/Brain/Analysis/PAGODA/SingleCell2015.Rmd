# The dataset used in this tutorial came from Camp et al 2015 with accession number
# GSE75140. Downloaded the expression data as a text file 
```{r}
# read in expression data
Data = read.table('GSE75140_hOrg.fetal.master.data.frame.txt',header = T)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
