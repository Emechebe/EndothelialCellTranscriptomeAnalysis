## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
Young = read.csv("YoungBrainEndothelialCells.csv", row.names = 1)
Old = read.csv("OldBrainEndothelialCells.csv", row.names = 1)
# Add a new column to annotate the Young as Young and the Old as Old
# Transpose the data
Young_t = as.data.frame(t(Young))
# Now annotate
Young_t$CellType= 'Young'
# Sanity check
Young_t[1:3,27998:27999]
# Do same for Old
Old_t = as.data.frame(t(Old))
Old_t$CellType= 'Old'
Old_t[1:3,27998:27999]
# Combine the two data frame
Combined = rbind(Young_t,Old_t)
# Sanity check
dim(Combined)
Combined[647:650,27998:27999]
# Save the CellType as annotation
Annotation =as.data.frame(Combined[,27999])
colnames(Annotation) = 'CellType'
# Now drop the CellType column in the combined data
library(dplyr)
Combined1 = Combined %>% select(-CellType)
# Sanity check
dim(Combined1)
# Now lets transpose the data back
Combined_t = as.data.frame(t(Combined1))
# Sanity check
Combined_t[1:3,1415:1417]
# Save the file
write.csv(Combined_t,'Combined.csv')
write.csv(Annotation,'CellAnnotation.csv')


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
