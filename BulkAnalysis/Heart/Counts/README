Purpose: Differential gene expression analysis between young cardiac endothelial cells and aged cardiac endothelial cells
Software used : DeSeq2  https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html
Input: Counts of reads generated from HTSeq python script. This is contained in CombinedHeartCounts.csv

Normalization/Transformation of data: Raw counts were normalized using the median to ratio method whil;e transformation of normalized values was done using a regularized log transformation. Both of these operations are implemented in the DeSeq2 package. 

An explanation of normalization methods implemented by DeSeq2 package as well as other packages like EdgeR can be seen here https://github.com/hbc/knowledgebase/wiki/Count-normalization-methods

In addition, these 2 papers (in addition to the DeSeq2 paper "Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 2014"), do a pretty good job in comparing the different analysis pipelines:
1) Comparison of normalization anddifferential expression analyses usingRNA-Seq data from 726 individualDrosophila melanogaster 2016
2) A Comparison of Methods: Normalizing High-Throughput RNA Sequencing Data 2015 

Result of analysis: The script for this analysis is called DeSeqScript.Rmd. The result of this analysis is a csv file called Heart_Counts_p_values.csv.
